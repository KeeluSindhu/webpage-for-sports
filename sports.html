    <p>A way to relieve stress and maintain a healthy body is by engaging in different types of sports. With them, you don’t just enhance your physical health, you also enjoy and have a great time with friends. Sports promote friendliness, teamwork, hard work, and discipline. The satisfaction you get while playing the sport equals, or even exceeds, the one you get from winning it. For information purposes, run through this article as it lists out the different types and examples of sports known today.</p>
    <p>Sports, physical contests pursued for the goals and challenges they entail. Sports are part of every culture past and present, but each culture has its own definition of sports. The most useful definitions are those that clarify the relationship of sports to play, games, and contests. “Play,” wrote the German theorist Carl Diem, “is purposeless activity, for its own sake, the opposite of work.” Humans work because they have to; they play because they want to. Play is autotelic—that is, it has its own goals. It is voluntary and uncoerced. Recalcitrant children compelled by their parents or teachers to compete in a game of football (soccer) are not really engaged in a sport. Neither are professional athletes if their only motivation is their paycheck. In the real world, as a practical matter, motives are frequently mixed and often quite impossible to determine. Unambiguous definition is nonetheless a prerequisite to practical determinations about what is and is not an example of play.</p>
